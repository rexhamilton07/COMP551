# COMP551
The three jupyter notebooks are assignments completed as part of COMP551 - Applied Machine Learning at McGill University with Professor Yue Li. A1 contains implementations of k-Nearest Neighbors and Decision Tree algorithms, A2 contains implementation of linear, logistic, and multi-class regression algorithms for text classification, and A3 contains implementations of multi-layer perceptrons (deep neural networks) for image classification.

Assignment 1 and 2 completed alongside Talia Cooper and Simon Arts, assignment 3 completed alongside Taewon Hwang and Tevin Choi. All three contain code adapted from Professor Li.
